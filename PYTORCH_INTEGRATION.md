## üîß Configuration

### Model Settings

Models are automatically loaded from the `bank/pytorch_models/` directory. If no pre-trained models are found, the system will use random weights and log a warning.

### Device Configuration

The system automatically detects and uses:
- **CUDA GPU** if available
- **CPU** as fallback

### Threshold Configuration

```python
# Anomaly detection threshold
anomaly_service.update_threshold(0.1)

# Fraud detection sensitivity
fraud_service.threshold = 0.7
```

## üìä Model Training

### Current Status

The current implementation uses:
- **Random weights** for demonstration
- **Simulated data** for testing
- **Basic architectures** ready for training

### Training Pipeline (Future)

```python
# Example training pipeline (to be implemented)
def train_fraud_detection_model():
    # Load historical transaction data
    # Prepare features
    # Train model
    # Save model weights
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'bank/pytorch_models/fraud_detection.pth')
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

- All ML analysis is performed **locally**
- No transaction data is sent to external services
- Models can be trained on **anonymized data**

### Model Security

- Models are **version controlled**
- **Model integrity** checks can be implemented
- **Adversarial training** for robustness

## üìà Performance

### Model Performance

| Model | Parameters | Input Features | Inference Time |
|-------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Fraud Detection | ~50K | 20 | <10ms |
