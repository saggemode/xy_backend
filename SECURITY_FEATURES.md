### 5. Security Utilities

#### Audit Logging Functions
```python
# Log an audit event
log_audit_event(user, action, description, severity='low', ip_address=None)

# Create security alert
create_security_alert(alert_type, severity, title, description, affected_user=None)

# Track user session
track_user_session(user, session_key, ip_address, user_agent)
```

#### Security Monitoring Functions
```python
# Check for suspicious activity
suspicious, reasons = check_suspicious_activity(user, ip_address, action)

# Generate security report
report = generate_security_report(start_date, end_date)

# Clean up old data
results = cleanup_old_data()
```

### 6. Management Commands

#### Security Report Generation
```bash
# Generate 30-day security report
python manage.py security_report

# Generate custom period report
python manage.py security_report --days 7 --format json --output report.json
```

#### Data Cleanup
```bash
# Clean up old security data
python manage.py cleanup_security_data

# Dry run to see what would be deleted
python manage.py cleanup_security_data --dry-run
```

## üîß Configuration

### Settings Configuration
The security system is configured in `settings.py`:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ... other middleware
    'accounts.middleware.SecurityMiddleware',
    'accounts.middleware.LoginSecurityMiddleware',
]

# Jazzmin admin configuration with security widgets
JAZZMIN_SETTINGS = {
    'dashboard_widgets': [
        {'name': 'user_stats', 'title': 'User Statistics'},
        {'name': 'financial_metrics', 'title': 'Financial Metrics'},
        {'name': 'recent_activity', 'title': 'Recent Activity'},
        {'name': 'system_health', 'title': 'System Health'},
    ],
}
```

### Admin Configuration
Security models are registered in `admin.py` with advanced features:
- Read-only audit logs
- Security alert management
- Session monitoring
- Bulk operations
- Export functionality

## üìä Monitoring and Alerts

### Suspicious Activity Detection
The system automatically detects:
- Multiple failed login attempts (5+ in 15 minutes)
- Logins from new IP addresses
- High activity levels (50+ actions per hour)
- Brute force attacks (10+ failed attempts from same IP)

### Security Alerts
Alerts are created for:
- Suspicious login attempts
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Unusual user activity
- System security events
- Compliance violations

### Alert Management
- **Status Tracking**: Open ‚Üí Investigating ‚Üí Resolved
- **Severity Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Resolution Notes**: Documentation of actions taken
- **Auto-resolution**: Old alerts automatically resolved after 7 days

log_audit_event(
    user=request.user,
    action='custom_security_event',
    description='Description of the event',
    severity='medium',
    ip_address=get_client_ip(request)
)
```

# Create custom security alert
create_security_alert(
    alert_type='custom_alert',
    severity='high',
    title='Custom Security Alert',
    description='Description of the security issue',
    affected_user=user
)
```

### Custom Dashboard Widgets
Add new widgets to `JAZZMIN_SETTINGS['dashboard_widgets']` and create corresponding templates in `templates/admin/widgets/`.
